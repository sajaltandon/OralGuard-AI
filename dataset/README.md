### ðŸ“š Dataset Description  

The dataset used for this project was sourced from **Kaggle**, a renowned platform known for its extensive collection of datasets and tools dedicated to data science and machine learning. This specific dataset comprises labeled dental images representing five distinct oral health conditions:  

1. **Tooth Discoloration**  
   - Abnormal coloring or staining of the teeth caused by factors like fluorosis, aging, or poor dental hygiene.  

2. **Hypodontia**  
   - A condition characterized by the absence of one or more teeth, often a congenital anomaly.  

3. **Dental Caries**  
   - Commonly known as cavities, caused by the breakdown of tooth enamel due to acid-producing bacteria.  

4. **Gingivitis**  
   - A form of gum disease that results in inflammation, redness, and swelling of the gums.  

5. **Mouth Ulcers**  
   - Painful sores inside the mouth caused by stress, injury, or underlying health issues.
